Wt is a jenkins Node?
=================

	Ø Node:- it is a vm where the entire workload is going to run


	Ø In jenkins a node is simply a machine that jenkins can use to run jobs


	1. Master/controller
  ==================

	Ø The main jenkins instance that coordinates jobs, schedules builds and manages configuration 

	2. Agent
  ========

	Ø Any machine (physical, vm, container or cloud instance) that executes the actual build steps sent by the controller 


Real time analogy
==============

	Ø Think of Jenkins nodes as workers in a factory

	1. The factory manager(controller) decides wt work needs to be done  and assigns it
	2.  the factory workers(agents) actually do the work assembling products and testing them etc.


Types Jenkins nodes
================

	1. Controller node
  ================

Purpose:- it will coordinate everything like scheduling jobs, dispatches them to agents
When to use: small set up's and demos
Real time analogy: the factory managers office


	2. Static agents
  ==============

Purpose :- it will always connect to the controller
When to use: when u have dedicated machines for builds with a predictable work load 
Real time analogy:- full time employees 

	3. Dynamic agents
  ================

Purpose :- it will create on demand and will destroyed after build completion 
When to use:- for scalable env where your workload fluctuate and it will save cost.
Real time analogy:- contract workers hired only when there is an extra work ,  then released afterward

	4. Permanent agents
  ==================

Purpose :- always available for specific tasks
When to use:- when builds require specialized env
RTA:- a specialized force or team who only works on certain work/task in the factory

	5. Inbound agents 
  =================

Purpose: Agent initiates the connection to the Jenkins controller
When to use:- when the controller cannot reach the agent due to some issue
RTA:- a remote worker who calls the manager to ask for work 

	6. Outbound agents
  ==================

Purpose:- controller initiates connection to the agent 
When to use:- when you can directly connect to agent machines
RTA:- Manger calling the worker to give some instructions 

Purpose of jenkins nodes
=====================

	1. Load distribution:- To preventing overloading the controller
	2. Specialized build envs:- some jobs may need specific OS, tool or hardware
	3. Salability:- spin up more agents when workloads increase 
	4. Isolation:- jobs run on separate machines so they don’t interfere with each other


======================================================================

Where and when to use Each node type
=================================

	1. Controller node:- small startup cicd pipeline with limited jobs and  it is simple to setting up and few resources only required
	2. Static agents:- large enterprise level app with multiple teams  and dedicated agents per team to avoid conflicts 
	3. Dynamic agents:- high build volume with peaks and dynamic agents on Kubernetes
	4. Permanent agents:-  builds requiring special task and dedicated specialized machines
	5. Inbound agents:- need access to run a job in jenkins
	6. Outbound agents:- no need access to run a job in jenkins
