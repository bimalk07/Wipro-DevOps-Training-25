Harness
=======

Wt it is?
=======

	Ø Harness is a next-gen CI/CD  platform that automates software delivery with built-in governance, verification and security 

Why its important
===============

	Ø It will remove manual work
	Ø It will reduce deployment risk
	Ø It will make delivery predictable 

Harness in CD
===========

	Ø It will automate end-to-end delivery
	Ø It will give progressive deployments: canary. Blue/green , rolling
	Ø It will automate verification and roll back using AI&ML
	Ø It will work across kubernetes, vms and serverless

Harness                                 vs                                       jenkins
===============================================

Feature
=======
	1.  set up - saas/cloud - slef-hosted manual 
	2. UI - modern , visual pipelines - plugin heavy 
	3. Deployment strategies - native canary , blue-green , rolling  - manual scritping
	4. Rollback - automated  - manual 
	5. Governance -   built-in-RBAC   - plugin-based
	6. Maintenance -   minimal   - high



Harness modules overview 
======================

	1. Continuous delivery:- deploy across env ( dev,qa,stag,prod) with different strategies 
	2. Feature Flags:- it will toggle features without redeploying 
	3. Chaos engineering:- it will simulate failures to improve resilience
