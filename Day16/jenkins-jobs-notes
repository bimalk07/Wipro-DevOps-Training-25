	1. Freestyle Project 
  =================

	Ø A flexible job type where you can configure everything via the jenkins UI form the source code checkout to build steps to post build actions

Real time analogy 
===============

	Ø You want to prepare one personal to do list on paper

	1. Buy groceries 
	2. Cook dinner
	3. Do laundry 
	4. Clean home

When to use
===========

	Ø Simple ci jobs
	Ø Non-complex build  without much automation 
	Ø Legacy project without pipleines
	Ø Whenever you don’t want write script for the pipeline 

Example:- compile ur code > run unit test cases > deploy war file  to tomcat


	2. Pipeline
  ==========

	Ø A scripted or declarative way of defining the entire CICD workflow in code

Real time analogy 
===============

	Ø Imagine writing a recipe in a cookbook instead of explaining it verbally each time.
	Ø Anyone can pick up the recipe (pick up script) and cook the recipe ( run the pipeline) the exact same way.

When to use
===========

	Ø Complex CICD workflows
	Ø IAC as  a code mindset
	Ø Reproducible build 


	3. Multi configuration Project 
  =========================

	Ø It will run the same build in multiple env or configurations, ex: os versions, jdk versions or browsers 

Real time analogy
===============

	Ø Like testing a new software on different laptops 

When to use
===========

	Ø Cross platform or multi env testing
	Ø Checking code compatibility 


	4. Folder
 =========

	Ø It is for organizing multiple jobs into a folder structure for better management 

Real time analogy
==============

	Ø Having project folders on your desktop instead of dumping all files together , keep your work neat and easy to navigate.

When to use
==========
	Ø Large jenkins set up with many jobs
	Ø Grouping jobs by a team, application or env


Example:- E-commerce project folder its containing build backend, fronted and deploy

	5. Multibranch Pipeline
  ====================

	Ø Automatically creates and manages pipelines for each branch in a repository 

Real time analogy
==============

When to use
==========

	Ø Git workflows with multiple branch's 
	Ø Automated ci for features branches


	6. Organization folder
 ===================

	Ø Automatically it will scan an entire GitHub or bitbucket  org and creates job for repo

Real time analogy
===============

	Ø Imagine a warehouse manager who scans all shelves and automatically set up a workstation for each crop or product that comes in warehouse.

Maven Project
============

	Ø Its like a freestyle project but pre-configured with maven

	Ø Jenkins doesn't just run mvn  commands blindly but it understands maven goals, pom file structure, reports, and dependencies 
	Ø Automatically it will archive reports like unit test results, code coverage results and more.


When to use
==========

	Ø When working with java app but with maven
	Ø When you want jenkins to natively parse pom files and run maven goals
	Ø When you need automatic test result and maven based reports.
